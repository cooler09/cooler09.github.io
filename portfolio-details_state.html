      <h2>State Street Apartments</h2>
      <p>
        The State Street Apartment complex is a 50-unit apartment development
        located on State Street in the Borough of Hamburg, Pennsylvania. The
        design incorporated and repurposed the old, abandoned Hamburg Elementary
        School in harmony with proposed new construction. TCG was contracted to
        fully design this land development. Our services included site layout,
        dwelling unit layout, traffic and parking layout and design, site
        grading, stormwater and post-construction stormwater management, erosion
        and sedimentation control design, and landscaping/lighting design. TCG
        was responsible for obtaining the required approvals/ permits from Penn
        DOT (H.O.P. for site access and utility connections), DEP (Planning
        Modules and NPDES), Berks County Conservation District (E&amp;S
        approval), and Hamburg Borough Council. The site is actively under
        construction and expects be operating within the following year.
