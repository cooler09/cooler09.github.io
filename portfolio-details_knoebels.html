      <h2>Knoebels “Impulse” Roller Coaster</h2>
      <p>
        The Impulse Roller Coaster at Knoebels Amusement Park was our client’s
        first steel coaster. It is one of the most detailed and exciting land
        surveying projects TCG has been involved with. The scope of services
        provided on this site included construction stakeout of nearly 160
        caissons, concrete pad locations, and almost 800 individual bolt
        locations. As-built survey services were also performed on the same to
        ensure accuracy prior to the coaster’s steel erection. Though the scope
        includes only a few items, TCG crews were on site through winter,
        spending four months ensuring seamless construction that allowed our
        client (Knoebels) to have this new attraction fully ready and
        operational for their opening day. Through their detailed efforts,
        construction and erection of the roller coaster was completed without
        incident.
