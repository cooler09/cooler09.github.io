        <h3>Headquarters</h3>
        <p>
          TCG’s Hamburg office is the main headquarters for The Crossroads
          Group. As the largest of the three offices, they offer a full array of
          all our services. What started in Quakertown, PA, has strategically
          relocated for easy accessibility to land development and telecom sites
          throughout the Pennsylvania.<br />
          The culture of this office, and TCG as a whole, is that of many family
          owned businesses. We work diligently with our clients to achieve their
          goals in a timely and cost-effective manner. We maintain this ethic
          for our teams as to encourage and improve upon individual skills and
          improve quality of life. The Hamburg office enjoys friendly
          competitions and social events. They also support the local community
          through sponsorships and volunteer time for events such as the
          Hamburg-er Festival, Art of the Brew Festival, The King Frost Parade,
          and collaborating with Hamburg Area High School’s mentorship program.

        <h3>Paxinos Branch</h3>
        <p>
          TCG’s Paxinos office was first established in Elysburg, PA, after the
          acquisition of Richard C. Parsons Land Surveying in November 2011.
          This team has since grown and moved just down the road to the Bebenek
          ‘Crossroads’ Plaza in Paxinos, a truly fitting location! The Paxinos
          team offers full engineering services in addition to the mainstay
          surveying that got this office started. On the occasional Friday, you
          can find this group taking a break from the typical day to day tasks
          by enjoying egg sandwiches for breakfast and watching movie trailers.
          As can be said for all TCG offices, we have an open-door policy.
          However, in the Paxinos community, more so than others, friends,
          neighbors, and clients actively use it to stop by and have a good,
          old-fashioned discussion and we love it!

        <h3>Pittsburgh Branch</h3>
        <p>
          TCG’s Pittsburgh office was established in November 2018. Although
          this office started out as a small remote group of 3, after adding a
          few new team members, they are now officially established in
          Bridgeville, PA. While the Pittsburgh office specializes in wireless
          telecommunications, their abilities extend to fiber engineering and
          data collection/field audits in the tri-state area of Western PA,
          Central/East Ohio, and West Virginia. Additionally, the team works to
          support both the survey and land development services in Hamburg and
          Paxinos. TCG Pittsburgh believes that the best way to break up work
          tension is a visit from our furry friends or a potluck style lunch. We
          whole heartedly believe and support the notion that happy employees
          willingly go the extra mile to make happy clients.

          <h4>Jeremiah D. Hoagland</h4>
          <span>President</span>
          <p>
            Jeremy was raised on a working farm in central PA after crashing on
            earth in what appeared to be an inter-galactic life sustaining
            escape vessel. After achieving maximum saturation level from the
            solar system’s yellow sun, he realized his real potential, instantly
            leading his high school football team to a state championship &amp;
            dominating a multitude of gladiatorial championships. Flying faster
            than a speeding bullet to Wilkes University, where he not only
            continued displaying his athletic prowess, but stunned his
            professors with his intellect &amp; dazzled the co-eds. Upon
            graduation he entered the Civil Engineering field, where he strives
            to bring those guilty of bureaucratic red tape to justice through
            super-human manipulation of stormwater runoff.

          <h4>Joshua D. Hoagland</h4>
          <span>Vice President</span>
          <p>
            Brother of one, second to none, our Vice President, Joshua Hoagland
            excels at fighting black bears (albeit under 300 lbs). Josh joined
            the company in 2008 after graduating Johns Hopkins University with a
            degree in Civil Engineering and worked his way up to obtaining his
            Professional Engineer license, managing projects, and eventually
            becoming VP. When he is not ridding the wilderness of dangerous
            bears, he likes to design subdivisions and commercial land
            developments. He has worked all throughout bear territory including
            Ohio, West Virginia, Maryland, and New York to name a few of our
            service areas outside of Pennsylvania. (He has yet to win a fight
            with a Grizzly Bear. It’s a work in progress.)

          <h4>Ron Bobiak</h4>
          <span>VP, Director of A&amp;E Services</span>
          <p>
            With 14 years Telecommunications experience &amp; a few gray hairs
            to accompany them, Ron serves as a partner with TCG.&nbsp;In 2017,
            he was given a gift that few people can truly understand.&nbsp;After
            a fateful day of yard work, he was unknowingly bitten by a
            [radioactive] Brown Recluse spider. Within days of the bite, it was
            apparent that surgery was necessary.&nbsp;As he healed, Ron
            discovered that he now had the power to live in the present &amp;
            laugh at the silly claims by his business partners about bears &amp;
            escape vessels.&nbsp;He also found a renewed strength of body &amp;
            mind to fight injustices by ne’er do wells &amp; scallywags alike.
            He now seeks to mentor young professionals to see their potential to
            succeed – in life &amp; business. When not combating evil, Ron
            enjoys time at home with his wife &amp; two rescue dogs, playing
            guitar, reading, or barbequing on the smoker.
